The Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) works by recursively removing variables and building a model on those variables that remain. It uses the model accuracy to identify which variables (and combination of variables) contribute the most to predicting the target attribute.
Letâ€™s use feature selection to help us decide which variables are significant that can predict employee turnover with great accuracy. There are total 18 columns in X, how about select 10?
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
rfe = RFE(model, 10)
rfe = rfe.fit(hr[X], hr[y])
print(rfe.support_)
print(rfe.ranking_)
cols=['satisfaction_level', 'last_evaluation', 'time_spend_company', 'Work_accident', 'promotion_last_5years', 
      'department_RandD', 'department_hr', 'department_management', 'salary_high', 'salary_low'] 
X=hr[cols]
y=hr['left']
