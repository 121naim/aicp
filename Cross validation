Cross Validation
Cross validation attempts to avoid overfitting while still producing a prediction for each observation dataset. We are using 10-fold Cross-Validation to train our Random Forest model.
from sklearn import model_selection
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
kfold = model_selection.KFold(n_splits=10, random_state=7)
modelCV = RandomForestClassifier()
scoring = 'accuracy'
results = model_selection.cross_val_score(modelCV, X_train, y_train, cv=kfold, scoring=scoring)
print("10-fold cross validation average accuracy: %.3f" % (results.mean()))
10-fold cross validation average accuracy: 0.977
The average accuracy remains very close to the Random Forest model accuracy; hence, we can conclude that the model generalizes well.
